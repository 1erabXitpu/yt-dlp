Bones arrives at the Admiral Benbow Inn on a stormy night and asks the innkeeper's son Jim Hawkins to let him know if he sees an old one-legged sailor, not knowing that a group of pirates is spying on them. The next day, they are visited by Bones' former shipmate Black Dog, who wants Bones to give him the map. Bones refuses, and they fight. After Black Dog flees, Bones suffers a stroke. Dr. Livesey arrives and examines him. Livesey warns Bones that if he keeps drinking rum, he will die. They are later visited by a blind pirate known as Blind Pew, who gives Bones a black spot. Bones panics and dies due to apoplexy. Jim takes the map.
 
Blind Pew leads the group of spying pirates on a raid of the inn. Jim flees, and as the pirates follow, Blind Pew trips into a barrel and rolls off of a cliff, falling to his death. Jim goes to Dr. Livesey's home, where he tells Livesey and Squire Trelawney what happened and presents them with the map. Trelawney decides to assemble a hunt for the treasure, and the three travel to Bristol. At the Spyglass Inn, Jim gets into a fight with a hostile pirate before they are interrupted by the inn's owner, Long John Silver, who offers to bring his ship, the *Hispaniola*, and his crew on their treasure hunt.
 
Following the lead of Captain Smollett, the crew heads for the island. Jim overhears Silver and his crew and finds out that he was Captain Flint's right-hand man and they plan to betray the rest of the crew for the treasure.
 
Jim sneaks back to Livesey and Trelawney to inform them of Silver's plan. Smollett proposes they play dumb for the time being, but one of the pirates spies on them and tells Silver that they know of the plan.
 
The next day, they see Treasure Island. Jim steals a rowboat and rows there himself, with Silver and some men chasing him. While hiding from them, he meets Ben Gunn, a former member of Flint's crew. Ben reveals that he and the rest of Flint's men were the ones who killed Flint after they betrayed him for the treasure. Three years later, Ben led the other men on a search for Flint's treasure, but they found nothing and the crew marooned him. He agrees to help Jim find the treasure.
 
On the ship, Livesey examines the island with a telescope and sees Jim, Silver's crew, and an abandoned fortress. Livesey, Trelawney, and Smollett steal a rowboat and go to the fortress. Silver is informed and demands they surrender, but they refuse. They have a shootout, and Jim and his allies win when Trelawney tricks the pirates into falling off of a cliff.

That night, Ben and Livesey find the treasure together. Jim sneaks onto Silver's ship and fights Israel Hands before going back to the fort, where he is captured. Silver tells Jim that Livesey gave him the map and left with Smollett and Trelawney. They find the spot on the map, but the treasure is not there. Livesey and Ben had already taken it and set up a trap. Livesey examines the pirates and gives them cigarettes, telling them that smoking is damaging their health, and they die. The rest of the crew sets sail back to England.
 
The film ends with some of the animated main characters alongside their voice actors in live-action. After the credits, the live-action pirate crew finds the hidden treasure and opens it, only to find a spring-loaded sign saying the end.
 
*Treasure Island* was a collaboration between David Cherkassky, director, and Radna Sakhaltuev, cartoonist. Their previous collaborations included the films *Adventures of Captain Wrongel* and *Doctor Aybolit*.
 
The live action "musical pauses" were songs performed by live actors that explained, for example, why it is a bad idea to drink alcohol or smoke. These scenes were added to help meet the deadline for the cartoon and were filmed at night.[2]
 
In 2012, Russia passed a law that prohibited showing films to minors that included smoking or alcohol consumption. The film has many scenes of rum drinking and smoking among pirates. A public outcry over the prohibition of films such as *Treasure Island* resulted in the adoption of an exception that allowed "movies that have significant historical and cultural value", including *Treasure Island*, to be exempt from the law.
