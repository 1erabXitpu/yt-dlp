**A word about the Exercises:** As individual preferences differ, you may not find some answers or the language itself to be apt or very good. It is up to you to change and modify accordingly, inshaaAllah. BUT when you give notes to the students, do take care to check the answers first, inshaaAllah.

Jazakallaahu khayra for understanding.
Actually it is not from 2 years.
Last year, only few sharjah schools started in the 2nd term (january 2018) so we were following I love Islam and Learning Islam last year for Term 1.
This year only all schools have started.
So it will only at the end of each term, we can have all solved exercises and worksheets related to that particular term inshaaAllah. May Allah make things easy for all of us.

we have our school inspection next week from Sunday, if some can help me with PPT`S on other chapters and Lesson plans from the part 1 book. pls it will really help me a lot.
May Allah reward all of us Aameen
 
Jazak Allah khair for this website. this is such a huge help especially since the new book is confusing the kids, since it has no direct question and answers. although it has more knowledge and information but it is quite a big change for the children.
please include more chapter notes for grade 7. indian schools are already holding exams on the first few chapters and the kids do not have enough experience with making notes or understanding the new slightly complicated chapters.
thank u again for all the help.
 
Assalamu alaikum wa rahmathullah,
You are doing a great and reward able job. so i would like to be a part of this effort like other teachers who are sharing their contents. Kindly give me your email id so i can send the worksheets through it.
May Allah almighty accept all of our efforts as benefiting in both world.
 
Wa alaikumus salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu.
I have one which is very basic and i am not satisfied that it is worth sharing. But I am working on it in an elaborate way, InshaaAllah once it is donem, i will share here inshaaAllah. Baarakallaahu Feekum.
 
assaalumalikum warehmatualli wabarkatahu.

Alhamdullilah all Lessopn plans, exercises and PPT have really helped us in our classes.
May Allah reward you all abundantly in duniya and akhirah for all of your great work.

yes, it can be used for personal purpose as PDF,
printing may be objectionable as some schools restrict it to purchase.
if we allow printing, there are complaints from schools.

During his old age, while Imam Ahmed was travelling, he stopped by a town. After Salah, he wanted to stay for the night in the masjid yard because he didn't know anyone in the town.
