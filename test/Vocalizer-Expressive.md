Hello all,
I know the answers to this question would be subjective, but I am still curious to hear them.
With all the various TTS voices available in the VoiceDream app, which ones do you personally consider as the best ones for reading fiction books? For example, I like James from Neospeech, but I feel he is more suited for reading articles and webpages, not so much for the content where more expression is required.
 
Recently the developer added Ivona voices to the app. My favourite is Joey. He's very clear and I like the way he pronounces things. No synthetic voice is perfect, but Joey is (in my opinion) as good as it gets.
 
Frankly, I go for either Neospeech James or Ivona Brian. To me, those are the two most human sounding voices. I guess you know, but in case you don't, you can hear samples of all of the available voices within Voice Dream under the voice store in settings.
 
Like most of us, reading speed is important to me. I bought one of the Ivona voices for my 4th generation Touch, and while it sounds great in the sample, it cannot operate at the speeds I usually use for reading. The Neospeech voices go plenty fast for me. Until I upgrade to newer hardware, I won't be using Ivona.

One of my favorite voices is Neospeech Bridget. I find that she sounds pleasant, and has some expression. Other voices I like include Neospeech James and Julie, Ivona Amy and Salli, and Acapela Rachel, Tracy and Lucy.
 
I have an iPad air 2. Ivona is the most expensive and most recommended quality voice. Speed and comprehension are my objectives. With practice the 700 word maximum is not as fast as I would like. I have found that voice dream reader is an incredible resource for brain stimulation while accumulating knowledge. Ivona Sally is The best that I have downloaded so far. Set at 700 not sure how accurate The speed is but clarity is excellent. Pausing after each sentence is helpful. Anyone with suggestions to help are appreciated.
 
I just upgraded to Salli from Ivona after reading the reviews and using the samples. I had Heather and James loading on in a package when I bought the app. I felt going past 270 words per minute with Heather and James was phonetically grating, and I liked the sample of Salli. The voice capabilities of Salli has far better range and her voice is realitively soothing. It was $7 on iTunes. A little pricey, but it seems worth it. The improvement in quality is a bit shocking. I enjoy listening that much more. Two thumbs up for Salli and can listening at much faster reading speeds.
 
Hi, I read a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction and for that I use the Acapella Peter (Happy) voice. I find that he reads quite well and has a lot of inflection and the tone is just awesome for the Harry Potter Universe all around. I so can't wait for VoiceDreamReader 4.0. I hope it will be coming soon.
 
Before owning my first iPhone, I owned Motorola phones and Samsung. I used many TTS apps until one day I found Ivona TTS. I really liked the sound of their voices because, at least to me, they are far better and less robotic than the other TTS engines out there.
 
Sadly, I don't know for how much longer Ivona voices will work with programs like Voice Dream Reader. The company does not exist anymore, and with the changes that always seem to go through iOS during updates, there is a chance with every major update that the Ivona voices will cease working. I hope not, though, as I too love Ivona voices.
 
The 2 non voice-over voices that i use are ivona Sally and acapela Sharon. But what i would like to see is a way to use either google tts or eloquence. I really like eloquence and i use it for voice dream for android. Id also like to see vocalizer zoe as well.
 
Of course, it depends on the person.
I've used the voice 'Heather' my entire life, starting in read2go and I was very happy to find it in voicedream. I think it's less about how good or bad the voice may be, but how comfortable you are with it. (I'm approaching 250 words per minute with this one.)
