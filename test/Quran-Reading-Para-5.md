Holy Quran is not an ordinary book and it was sent to the most beloved prophets to ALLAH. It is not acceptable to touch or recite the Quran unless you have done wudu. Taking a shower and wearing clean clothes is appreciated but not a necessity. However, make sure to make wudu before touching Quran.

In Islam, reciting the Quran holds great significance, and there are numerous virtues associated with this practice, encompassing a wide range of spiritual, moral, and practical benefits in the life of a practicing Muslim.
 
Reciting the Quran serves as a source of spiritual guidance (Huda) for Muslims. It provides clear instructions and principles for leading a righteous and fulfilling life according to Islamic teachings. The Quran is often described as a source of divine light (Noor) that illuminates the heart and soul. Through regular recitation, believers seek enlightenment and a deep connection with Allah.
 
Muslims believe that reciting the Quran brings abundant rewards (Thawab) from Allah. Every letter recited is believed to carry immense merit, and the act is highly valued in the sight of Allah. The recitation of the Quran is also associated with the blessings of Allah. It is believed to bring prosperity, peace, and an increased sense of well-being to the individual and their surroundings.
 
Since Ramadan is the month of the Quran, completing it during Ramadan is a common goal for many Muslims. There are several plans and approaches to achieve this, and individuals can choose a method that aligns with their reading speed, understanding, and personal schedule.
 
Many Muslims attend Tarawih prayers at night in Ramadan, during which a portion of the Quran is recited. Coordinate your Quran reading with the Tarawih prayers to complete the Quran by the end of Ramadan.
 
Remember, the goal is not just to finish but to connect with the Quran spiritually and intellectually. Choose a plan that suits your pace and allows for contemplation and understanding of the verses. Additionally, make sincere dua (supplication) for guidance and blessings during your Quranic journey.
 
If you are starting out in the last days of Ramadan and want to gain rewards, having a companion can be of help. If all family members divide the number of juz among themselves, you would be able to complete one Quran as a family and everyone gets blessings. As a family of 3, all of you can take 10 juz each or 5 juz each can be recited by a family of 6. Involving your family in good deeds is appreciated by ALLAH.
