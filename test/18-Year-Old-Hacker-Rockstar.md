Arion Kurtaj, an 18-year-old hacker pivotal in the Grand Theft Auto VI footage leak, has received a life sentence within a hospital prison. In a ruling on Thursday, a British judge deemed Kurtaj a high risk to the public due to his continued desire to engage in cybercrimes.

In August, a London jury established Kurtaj's involvement in cyberattacks against entities such as GTA VI developer Rockstar Games, Uber, and Nvidia. Despite being diagnosed with autism and deemed unfit for trial, the jury's focus was on determining whether he committed the acts, not his criminal intent.
 
During the recent court hearing, reports surfaced of Kurtaj's violent behaviour while in custody, involving numerous instances of injury or property damage, as detailed by the BBC. A mental health evaluation affirmed his persistent intent to pursue cybercrimes imminently. His confinement within the hospital prison is indefinite, contingent on a reassessment by medical professionals regarding public risk.
 
While on bail for hacking Nvidia and British telecom provider BT/EE, Kurtaj leaked 90 videos of GTA VI gameplay in September. Even under police protection at a hotel, he orchestrated an attack on Rockstar Games using an Amazon Fire Stick and a newly acquired smartphone, keyboard, and mouse, according to another BBC report. Kurtaj was subsequently arrested following the incident.

The official GTA VI trailer debuted earlier this month, amassing millions of views despite the premature release on X (formerly Twitter) and the trove of leaked videos by Kurtaj. Kurtaj's defence highlighted the trailer's success during the sentencing, but the judge emphasised the tangible impact on real companies and individuals affected by Lapsus$. Rockstar Games reported spending $5 million on recovery efforts following the attack.
 
The teenager charged with hacking Rockstar Games and leaking footage from GTA VI has been sentenced to life in a hospital prison. Arion Kurtaj from Oxford, England, was a member of the global hacker gang Lapsus$, which has been deemed responsible for previous attacks on companies such as Uber and Nvidia.
 
The 18-year-old Kurtaj was on bail for hacking Nvidia and the British telecom operator BT when he carried out the hack. Despite being in a hotel in police protection, Kurtaj was able to breach Rockstar using an Amazon Firestick, the hotel TV and a mobile phone.
 
A 17-year-old was arrested by the City of London police on Sep. 22, reportedly in connection with the hacks of Uber and Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar Games. The Desk reported that the teen is being held on charges including conspiracy to attack at least two different computer systems.
 
On Sep. 18, 90 videos of gameplay animation were leaked to GTA Forums by user "teapotuberhacker." The videos totaled more than 50 hours of footage and seemed to confirm rumored gameplay details like the first-ever female single-player character and the game's setting in a modern-day version of the franchise's Vice City.
 
The hacker appeared to be blackmailing Rockstar Games by threatening to release source code for GTA V and GTA VI, and attempting to sell the code back. The public release of that code would make GTA V vulnerable to hacks and exploitation and would do the same for GTA VI when it drops.
 
By Sep 19, Rockstar Games had issued takedown notices across social media and posted a tweet confirming that it had "suffered a network intrusion." The developer added that it was "extremely disappointed" by the release of information but promised that work on the game would continue as planned.

The 18-year-old hacker charged with breaking into Rockstar's data and leaking at least 90 videos worth of GTA 6 development materials has been sentenced by a UK court to indefinite life in a hospital prison.
 
In July, Kurtaj was deemed psychiatrically unfit for trial, shifting the jury's focus away from a standard verdict of guilty or not guilty, and toward determining whether the alleged hacks were actually committed.
 
Not a month later, we learned that Kurtaj's hack on Rockstar was carried out in a hotel room, well after his laptop was confiscated following a previous hack, using an Amazon Firestick, a hotel TV, and a mobile phone. He was quickly re-arrested.
 
Kurtaj was accused alongside a 17-year-old member of the same hacking group, Lapsus$, who was likewise accused of blackmail, fraud, and charges under the Computer Misuse Act. Rockstar was far from Lapsus$'s only target, with Nvidia to Microsoft to phone companies reporting hacks.

The teenage hacker behind the massive GTA 6 gameplay leak was in court today for sentencing. 18-year-old Arion Kurtaj was found guilty by a UK jury in August but the sentencing had been delayed until today.
 
Along with the 17-year-old accomplice, they successfully hacked Nvidia, Uber, BT, and Revolut over the course of a couple of years. Despite being on bail during these times, they continued to wreck havoc.
 
Mr Kurtaj did not stand trial due to being deemed unfit to do so by psychiatrists. More recently, Judge Patricia Lee postponed the sentencing today. The judge also had Kurtaj detained under the Mental Health Act as she believed he was suffering from a mental illness.
 
Arion Kurtaj stunned Rockstar Games last year when in September, he leaked a slew of clips from an unreleased GTA game which went viral. The clips showed gameplay of what was alleged to be from the development version of GTA 6, which led to one of the biggest investigations ever to be launched in the gaming industry. The clippings were forcefully taken down from all social media platforms, YouTube, and anywhere Rockstar Games could possibly delete them from.
 
The footage looked raw in terms of the visuals but revealed a whole lot of information about the upcoming game, which Rockstar Games then went on to claim has been in the works for a long time now. After a long and tiring investigation, the hacker was caught and sentenced on multiple counts, and his modus operandi was quite surprising when revealed.
 
Arion was based out of Oxford, England, and was a key part of a Hacker group named Lapsus$, which was also behind data breaches of Uber and Nvidia. The group is based out of the UK and has been termed quite dangerous. The group is infamous for hacking into secure servers of large companies, and blackmailing for ransoms. The group was found to have committed their first hack back in 2021 and had been on a hacking streak ever since, before breaking into Rockstar Games.
 
Despite being barred from using the Internet, Arion somehow managed to access cloud computing services, which helped his exploitation of the Rockstar Games servers. This ultimately led him to access and leak several old footage of the unfinished, raw clips of the upcoming Grand Theft Auto game.

A life sentence in a hospital prison awaits Arion Kurtaj, the 18-year-old hacker who leaked Grand Theft Auto 6 footage online. The BBC reports that a British judge decided on Thursday that Kurtaj poses a serious threat to the public as he has not given up his desire to engage in cybercrime.
 
Kurtaj was part of Lapsus$, a hacking group that targeted GTA 6 developer Rockstar Games and other firms, such as Uber and Nvidia. A jury in London concluded in August that Kurtaj was responsible for the cyberattacks, but he was not tried for his criminal intent as he has autism and was unfit to stand trial. The jury only had to determine if he did the acts he was accused of.
 
The official trailer for GTA 6 was released earlier this month, and it got hundreds of millions of views despite the leak of the videos by Kurtaj and the early release of the trailer on X (formerly Twitter).
 
Although we're all still reeling from Insomniac Games being hit with the biggest hack in gaming history earlier this week, that "honour" previously went to Rockstar Games, who was hacked last September, causing tons of early Grand Theft Auto 6 footage to flood the internet and reveal the studio's plans for the next big entry in the series.
 
Shortly after the GTA 6 leaks hit the internet, it was revealed that the hac
