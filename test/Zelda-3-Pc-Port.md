Recently, we published a guide on how to download, set up, and play The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask's Native PC Port on the Steam Deck, and it blew up. It almost got to 1,000 likes on X, and we were stunned by the response. However, there was one issue: It isn't Ocarina of Time. Of the two, Ocarina of Time is definitely more popular, and support for the game is coming to the Majora's Mask Recompiled project, but there is a Native PC Port for the game available right now with tons of extra features including Randomizer support, custom model and texture support, cheats, and much more. This is the Ship of Harkinian.
 
Developed by the Harbour Masters, Ship of Harkinian is a full decompilation and recompilation of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, making it a native PC application. This comes with many benefits, including high-resolution support, higher framerates, cheats, changing things whenever you want (like clothing color), and so much more. And, of course, it fits perfectly on the Steam Deck with gamepad support, 16:10 resolutions, and extremely low battery drain (5.5W - 6.5W at 60 FPS).
 
NOTE: You will need a PAL (Europe) copy/ROM of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time to use this (The Master Quest version is supported). We will not provide the game or links on where to get it. While SteamDeckHQ completely supports emulation for game preservation, we don't condone piracy in any way, shape, or form.
 
Head to Desktop Mode and go to the Ship of Harkinian GitHub's newest release. Download the "Linux/SteamDeck" version by clicking the giant button with the same label. At the time of writing, this is version 8.0.5.

Now, take what we downloaded and extract it into a new folder. I recommend creating a folder on your Desktop to put it in for ease of access, but there shouldn't be an issue as long as they are in a folder.
 
I love the original style of the game, but it is a bit nice to see some better textures all around. It can make the game feel completely different, and with how easy it is to toggle on and off, it feels like a no brainer to have them installed just in case. I recommend using OoT Reloaded from GhostlyDark. For the Deck, I would go to that link and download the oot-reloaded-v10.4.2-soh-otr-hd.7z for the regular HD version. You can download the 4K resolutions if you'd like, but it isn't necessary on the Deck's small screen.
 
Once that is done, open the file and you will see four different OTR files. You are going to take those files and move them to the "mods" folder in the Ship of Harkinian directory. That's it! You can now toggle "Alternate Textures" when in-game through the enhancements menu (more on how to access this below).
 
To apply enhancements in the game, you will need to bring up a small menu at the top of the screen and click on the enhancements you want. This isn't accessible without a keyboard, so we need to change some settings to make it possible to access.
 
For my time playing, I decided to change how both trackpads act to make it easier. On the left trackpad, I created a virtual menu that can not only bring up the enhancements menu, but save and load states and toggle custom textures you install. On the right trackpad, we change it to act as a mouse and pressing the trackpad emulates a left mouse click. This will allow you to interact with the menu as you please.
 
This one is smaller, but if you want to get the most out of the game, I recommend increasing the framerate and internal resolution. You can do this from the "Settings" tab in the Enhancements menu. I would recommend changing the internal resolution to 200% and setting the FPS to 60 (or 90 if preferred). You can also click the "Match Refresh Rate" box if you'd like, but if you change your refresh rate, you will need to go back to this menu and manually change the FPS to match.
 
One of the awesome features of Ship of Harikinian is the integrated Randomizer support. This randomizes different aspects of the game, like the items you pick up, making the playthrough more exciting for those who have already played the game. But it isn't as straightforward, so I wanted to give some information on how to use it.
 
You first need to generate the Randomizer file, which you do in-game! After you boot up the game, open up the Enhancements menu and go to the Randomizer tab. Once there, you can change randomizer settings if preferred, but if you want to, just click on "Generate Randomizer." Once you do, it will generate a file, and you can now play the Randomizer version!
 
And there you go! You should be all set to play and enjoy the game to the fullest and take advantage of the amazing port this is. Hats off to Harbour Masters for creating an amazing way to experience Ocarina of Time. And yes, it is fantastic to play on the Steam Deck, so I would consider this essential if you want to experience one of the best games from the N64 era in a new, modern light.

The benefits of a libretro port of Zelda Classic compared to just using the various versions found on the web could be many, one being having the clean RetroArch frontend with full controller support instead of having to fiddle with gamepad wrappers such as Xinput Plus just to get a modern Xbox One gamepad to work with Zelda Classic for the end user (been there, done that).
 
An other benefit could be to have the ability to within the core options itself to have custom configs for each custom quests, and thereby selecting which version of Zelda Classic to use based on the custom quest (running a ZC 2.10 quest in ZC 2.5 may cause issues in terms of both gameplay- and completing the actual quest).
 
I have no idea whatsoever how much work this would be to port over to libretro, how popular Zelda Classic is nowadays (something tells me it peaked 10 years ago), if this could end up as a niche that only few people care about and so on.
 
This seems like the perfect year for this release, too. With the reported delays to the Nintendo Switch successor, it seems like multiple big games like Pokemon Legends Z-A have been pushed back to launch alongside the new console. This leaves a cavernous void in 2024 that Nintendo needs to fill. Filling it with ports of classic games is a cheap, easy way to make big bucks with very little effort, while also appeasing fans and keeping them glued to your hardware in the latter days of its life cycle.
 
In summary, they've worked out how to decompile N64 games into code on the fly which can then be run natively on PC and easily ported to almost any other format. This allows coders to use the original Nintendo ROM as a starting block for an actual PC version that can have mods, ray tracing, 120fps boosts, new textures etc because it's not emulation, it's a PC game being dynamically written from the original game code on the fly as you play it.
 
Decomps are great and have been going for a while now (especially Wipeout: Phantom Edition and Perfect Dark, let alone Ship of Harkenian) - but they've been always for the process of untangling code of one game at a time, fully, and then using that code to lash up an x86 program.
 
The big thing here is that this method of Recompilation (in other words, decompiling a ROM on the fly - something that harks back to early N64 emulation) covers a lot more than just Majora's Mask - in fact, provided you know the microcode used to do specific things in any particular N64 game, the recomp tool has enough information to create a binary on the fly for any N64 game, and anyone skilled enough (not me) should be able to make a similar project to this Majora's Mask recomp in a matter of days. Take this video, for example:
 
Memes aside, no one in their right mind would be bothered to fully decompile Supes 64, and then look at the code to make up a x86 port. In fact, the only GitHub that chased that dream has not been active in three years. But there it is, with Ray Tracing and all the visual effects being relatively intact.
 
It's a great way to go about things, but this has happened primarily because the N64 is pretty much mapped out in terms of everything it can do (with the help of a couple of industry leaks), and the library is pretty small so there's not much deviation in specific code - something like the PS1 had code pushed through it in a myriad of ways by different developers, so it's an incredibly tough to nigh-impossible task to map everything out as opposed to just relying on something like cycle-accurate emulation or FPGA recreations.
 
Download either the Windows or Linux version, drop in your US ROM that you've got (either by dumping the cart, extracting it from a VC game, extracting it from the GameCube Zelda collectors disk, or just pirating it lol lmao) and away you go.
 
I think it's fair to consider both sides of the game preservation coin - the game as it truly was (which I think emulation is a great thing for and why I'll never get mad at re-releases which are just ROMs in an emulation shell), and making the game more widely available while adding QoL stuff, as long as it's not overly tinkered with.
 
We should be able to find ways to play Virtua Racing, say, in its arcade guise, the Mega Drive version, the 32X release, Saturn, etc, because that's gaming history. If we can
