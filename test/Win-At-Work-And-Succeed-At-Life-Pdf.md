They rebuilt their lives from the ground up. I am deeply proud of them and of their achievements, and I am humbled to be their daughter, niece, and cheerleader. Every opportunity I have had in my life is because of their sacrifice, hard work, and resilience.
 
Without getting into the why, we will start with facts: People leave their home countries, and people choose to come to the United States. With the caveat that immigrants are not a monolithic group, what challenges might some face when they get here?

I recently helped my mother call her auto insurance company to argue against an increase in her rate. It turns out that the company automatically estimates her mileage, not based on her history of driving but a seemingly arbitrary number, and puts the onus on the customer to call and report the actual mileage in order to accurately calculate her payment. While practices like these are not inherently nefarious, they require that you (1) understand what the statement is telling you, (2) know what to do about it, and (3) can articulate your argument. If not, you lose more of your money, essentially paying a language penalty.
 
First-generation immigrants may also face psychological trauma or adverse health effects from the circumstances of migration from their home country, or violence endured during their journey. This is especially true for women and girls, who face an increased risk of gender-based violence, abuse, and trafficking.
 
Immigrants overcome these obstacles and more with an intense motivation to re-establish their lives and create a brighter future for their children and loved ones. While doing so, they contribute to economic growth, spark innovation and creativity, and enrich the food, art, and musical landscape of America. But that success is not guaranteed, and it may not be enough to reach the level of prosperity and integration that results in socioeconomic advancement and the opportunities it provides. Not every immigrant is stuck in a low-paying job forever, but neither is every immigrant a successful, millionaire entrepreneur.
 
When your early childhood years are filled with uncertainty, and you learn responsibility at a young age, it seems too risky to pursue a career in the arts or other profession without a guaranteed income.
 
How can I ensure that my family is able to continue to live a life of dignity and prosperity, while facing the reality of what it takes to guarantee that for them? Will I be able to guarantee it for myself, and my future family if I have one?
 
Feel free to set up variations of this, of course, and this would be just as easy to do in a notebook as it is to do digitally, but some sort of daily check-in that forces you to stop and be intentional has nothing but benefits, in my experience. This takes me under five minutes in the morning and in the evening and is well worth the time spent.
 
Finally, alongside a weekly review, I highly recommend weekly planning. Pick a day of the week (Sundays for me) to look ahead to the upcoming week and just make sure everything is lined up properly. Are all of your meetings or appointments in spots where they will work out? Are there specific projects you want to spend time on this week? Can you make space for them?

With all of the changes happening in my life, I knew I needed to stop and reflect more on how I was feeling or what might be bothering me and where there were areas of improvement. It would have been so much easier with all of these shifts in my life to just keep getting pulled along in new directions and not make space to stop and figure out what I wanted.
 
Making a systems change is building a new habit in many cases, so you need to make sure you give yourself ample time and space to build those habits. As James Clear has described in his book Atomic Habits, habits also require a cue to kick them off and remind you to do them.
 
Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world.
 
One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.
 
All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability.
 
You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with.
 
I think people who pretend you can be super successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of your life) are doing a disservice. In fact, work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success.
 
People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.
 
The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it.
 
A special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, ideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to be helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!)
 
This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly.
 
Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham are my benchmarks for this. YC was widely mocked for the first few years, and almost no one thought it would be a big success when they first started. But they thought it would be great for the world if it worked, and they love helping people, and they were convinced their new model was better than the existing model.
 
It is obviously an incredible shame and waste that opportunity is so unevenly distributed. But I've witnessed enough people be born with the deck stacked badly against them and go on to incredible success to know it's possible.

I practice martial arts (Taekwondo) since I was 5 years old and when I reflected all those years of training, I can see how it changed my life for the better. Martial arts, being one of the most physically and mentally demanding activities out there, can have a real psychological effect on its practitioners. I feel it helps to boost my confidence level and make me mentally stronger to persevere at whatever challenges life throw at me over the years. These help me succeed both at work and in life as discussed below:
 
Martial arts demand a lot of determination. To achieve a certain level of mastery, practitioners need to put in a lot of effort and hours of intense practice. First, practitioners need to master basic skills and then patiently moves to learn more advanced skills. At the same time, practitioners need to build up their endurance level and increase their stamina so they can execute those skills seamlessly in any situation. Finally, practitioners need to develop mental toughness and have strong grit when they are pitted with an impossibility or against overwhelming odds.
 
How about those moments when you need to break a cement brick with your bare hand during your black belt test or you are doing some board breaking? Of course, your technique is important but eventually, it all comes down to your mental belief. I still remember the moment when I failed to break the cement brick during my pre-black belt test. Afterward, my Grandmaster told me:
 
He is right and I vividly remember that message till today. I hesitated too much as I was worried it is not going to break and feared it will injure my hand. Martial arts teach you to overcome your fears and fight the greatest battles from within. It instills among practitioners that they can conquer every battle as long as they are willing to face themselves and their fears.
 
The journey to reclaim my life from anxiety took six months that felt like six years. Along the way, I learned how to manage my anxiety (there is no defeating it) so that I could live my life again: accept everything as it is, try to succeed without attaching to the outcome, and let thoughts come and go.
 
It forced me to stop almost everything in my life: writing, running errands, hanging out with friends, and taking p
