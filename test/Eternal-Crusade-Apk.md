I am, and always will be a massive 40k buff, I've read probably a good half of the novels that've been been released along with all of the rules up until about 2012 when I stopped playing. (I played tabletop for 10 years x\_x) However, despite owning nearly all the games from the oldentimes such as final liberation and chaos gate aaaaall the way up to Battlefleet Gothic: Armada, I do not own Eternal Crusade. However, I would be more than willing to buy it if someone who's played it could talk me into it, so feel free to poke me on TS if you have the time! Until then, NO FEAR, NO PITY, NO REMORSE!
 
The crusades have been going on for over 110 years, like his father before him, he had fought in countless battles on countless worlds and slaughtered countless enemy soldiers. He had been wounded numerous times, his armor was worn, scratched and damaged and the accolades adorning it were tattered.
 
As he stood on a cliff face overlooking the capital city of Montreria, he looked into the distance contemplating about life. Tomorrow he would be storming the city walls, the last stronghold before the planet fell, another crusade, another conquest, another battle.
