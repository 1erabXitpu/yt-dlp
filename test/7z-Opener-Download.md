If the opener is not on the same origin as the current page, functionality of the opener object is limited. For example, variables and functions on the window object are not accessible. However, navigation of the opener window is possible, which means that the opened page can open a URL in the original tab or window. In some cases, this makes phishing attacks possible, where a trusted page that is opened in the original window is replaced by a phishing page by the newly opened page.
 
In addition, there are a few properties: then, [Symbol.toStringTag], [Symbol.hasInstance], [Symbol.isConcatSpreadable], which are used by various JavaScript operations. These properties have values undefined. All other properties generate a SecurityError DOMException when accessed.

Winter finally gave up and walleye season is upon us, here are some walleye opener tips! Now that the season is here, having a good game plan for opening day and the rest of the early season can mean the difference between spring fishing success and frustration.
 
This year, again because of the late spring, I will also target any areas where incoming rivers or creeks are present as these inlets often have warmer water and draw baitfish and walleyes during early spring as well.
 
When fish or likely-looking areas are found, breaking out the jigs and minnows is usually a good starting point. Spot-tail shiner minnows are the bait of choice on lakes with good populations of those minnows, while fathead works just as well on lots of small, shallow lakes.
 
Regardless of the jig chosen, fishing season is finally here, and a walleye dinner is a goal for many anglers. The tips just offered are designed to help anglers accomplish that goal. Good luck with the opener and remember to include a youngster in your next outdoor adventure!
 
This magic is all possible because our home came with a MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener ($289). Mine is one of the more expensive models due to the included camera, and it was installed by a pro. MyQ also makes cheaper, DIY-friendly options and accessories that can give any garage the convenience of a smart home, with the help of a little Wi-Fi.
 
It worked right away, and easily. Since my garage opener has a built-in camera, I see both a video feed that I can tap into whenever I want and a large, round icon below it to open or close the garage door. You can set the icon to respond to either a quick touch or a long press. A long press is handy if you think you'll be opening the app often to check video feeds, but otherwise the default quick press is fine. You'll also see a status of whether it's already open or closed, and how long it's been in that position. (As I write this, my garage has been closed for five hours. Neat!)
 
The garage responds as quickly to the app as it does to a regular button clicker, with one caveat: Choosing to close the garage with the app causes it to flash its lights and beep several times before the garage will begin to close, and will still beep and flash until closing is complete. It's for safety reasons, since the garage doesn't know whether anyone else is in the garage while you're closing it or whether you're nearby to make sure the garage path is clear of anyone walking in or out.
 
The default owner of the MyQ (that is, whoever set it up first in your home) also gets an onslaught of notifications every time the garage is opened and closed, whether via app or with your standard garage door buttons. In comparison, when you're an added user, you won't get any notifications by default. Both parties can go into the app, select the gear icon on the garage door (or other MyQ product in question), and edit the notifications they're getting for the specific product.
 
I set up both my and my husband's phones to get notifications about our garage being open for more than 10 minutes, and another for myself if it was open for an hour. You can add a lot more notifications, and you can also set it up to work with Amazon Key to get deliveries right into your garage (and get notified about that too). I haven't been able to talk my husband into using it, but the included camera in my model makes me feel comfortable giving it a try.
 
Speaking of video, MyQ does have storage subscription plans for its video products (the brand also has video garage door openers, a video keypad, and a stand-alone camera). The first tier starts at $20 a year and goes up to $100 a year, and depending on which tier you pick you get additional features like face, person, and motion detection, detection zones, and either seven or 30 days of storage.
 
You'll get 30 days free when you first set it up, but I didn't find myself using any of the subscription features in my 30 days, since I just wanted the ability to control my garage door rather than have video footage I could look back on.
 
I can't tell you about the DIY experience with either the openers or controllers since I didn't DIY mine. I've linked to the option that looks just about identical to my professionally installed one, but the model you can buy is DIY-intended. If you want professional installation, you have to go through a local LiftMaster dealer. I've been really happy with my installed model, and the motor is so quiet my mom now wants one. (She has no idea about the smart features; she just likes the quiet.) I can't guarantee what local dealers will charge, but the $289 DIY model is a solid price for a garage door opener.
 
But if I was adding this onto an existing garage and didn't want to change out my whole opener? If I had the exterior freedom and the Wi-Fi range, I'd probably choose the Smart Garage Control ($25) and the Video Keypad ($99) to get the smarts, the video, and the beep-free closing if I walk out of my garage without my button. That's the fun thing about MyQ's product lineup: There's a perfect garage door combo for us all.

An "opener" is a pitcher -- normally a reliever -- who starts a game for purposes of matching up against the top of the opponent's lineup in the first inning, which has traditionally been the highest-scoring inning, before being relieved by a pitcher who would otherwise function as a starter. This allows for a team to counter its opponent's first three batters with the pitcher it feels has the best chance for success against them.
 
Great upgrade to an existing opener. Was quick and easy to install, five minute setup and fifteen minute install. Now I can the check status of the door and operate it from my smart phone. Color blends in with the garage. Nice upgrade for a none Wi-Fi garage door opener.
 
Works Great as Advertised. Set up was simple and easy, 15 mins tops. Works as expected. Text notifications come every time. Love how you can set a schedule for the garage door. I have it close every night at midnight just in case someone left the door open.
 
Simple set up. Added my wife as co-owner and she was able to set up her phone just as easily without my help. I am planning on ordering a second sensor for the other bay in garage giving us ability to monitor house safely from anywhere via our phones.
