**ZSoft Uninstaller** is a software utility developed by ZSoft Software for Microsoft Windows operating systems. When users delete programs using the default uninstaller, it often fails to remove all associated files and registry entries. ZSoft Uninstaller addresses this issue by capturing snapshots of the hard drive and registry before and after program installations, facilitating complete program removal.[1]
 
ZSoft Uninstaller primarily focuses on eliminating residual files and registry entries that remain after uninstalling a program. It starts by examining the hard drive and registry before a program installation. Once the user installs the program they wish to analyze, ZSoft Uninstaller re-examines the same hard drive and registry, comparing the changes between the pre-installation and post-installation states. It logs each difference detected, allowing users to revisit and delete the program along with all associated files at their convenience.[1]

Life Hacker.com recently featured a program called Revo Uninstaller. This program tracks your installs like Total Uninstall and Zsoft Uninstaller does so you can completely remove them. Also has a start up manager, secure deletion tool, junk files cleaner, browser history cleaner and a bunch of other stuff.
 
I never was completely convinced by ZSoft's uninstaller. Yes it was quick but it just didn't seem to have the useability of Total Uninstall and most importantly Total Uninstall has never let me down, ZSoft's did the first time I used it.
 
Never heard of this Revo Uninstaller, though I seem to remember trying a similar program from 'Giveaway of the Day' a couple of months back and found it had the potential to cause problems so got rid of it. May give this a try though when I get a chance.
 
I not convinced any of these programs are totally safe. If you track an install with Zsoft or Total Uninstall and 5 months later you decide to uninstall the program you tracked so may things have changed on the system since than. How do you know if any of the files or reg entires for the program have changed since the install. Than you uninstall with the uninstaller programs and gut everything that is is the install log. The potential to do damage seems very real to me. I have been using Zsoft to track installs of programs I am trying out and than remove if I don't like a week or so later not half a year later so there isn't that many changes to my system at that point.
 
I'm not totally sure what and why it removed system files (luckily it wasn't something that would kill Windows). Why it thought the program installed them I don't know because the program didn't install the system files. It's now a dead issue to me since I ditched the program altogether. Another program to stay the hell away from was that Giveaway Of The Day program called Cleanse Uninstaller - it is very prone to totally f'ing up and wanting to remove way too much.

I know it takes a snap shot of your system before the install and than after and compares the two and creates a uninstall log with the difference. If you do anything after the install of a program that creates files before you do the after snap shot it will record those new files. I immediately do the after snap shot when I install a new program so that doesn't happen.
 
I have forgot to do that a few times and played around with the newly installed program and than remembered I didn't do the after snap shot. I do the after snap shot and look at the log and there are all kinds of files that have nothing to do with the new program.
 
The problem is when we do what we shouldn't have done... Then we'll say that the culprit is the application like ZSoft Uninstaller and/or Total Uninstall... A typical human reaction. There aren't here a bug question - only a user performance issue.
 
Exactly. The nice thing about Total Uninstall is if you have it close down to "install more than one program" then happen to log off or restart Windows it will run at startup so that it can finish the watched installation report. Although Total Uninstall is much slower it hasn't as of yet given me any grief.
 
I even monitor the programs that I self-install by just extracting zip files. I've never had a problem after uninstalling. I even loaded one very large partitioning utlility that many users had problems uninstalling due to several files that loaded into the system directory. I ran the program uninstaller, and then Zsoft's. I then did a file search, and a registry search for related strings. Except for one or two strings created after the program was installed, all files and registry keys were deleted.
 
I make sure to check the log files (Zsoft calls them \*.zulog) after every installation and see if there are any files that have been added to my OS directory. If there are, I research them to make sure they were loaded by the program I just installed. Is it possible that you had an Auto Windows update at the same time Zsoft was completing it's "after" installation scan, or one of your security programs was updating?
 
I find Zsoft's log alot easier to read than the GUI file/registry screen created after a system scan by the last freeware version of Total Uninstall. I just scanned the images on Martau's site of the latest TU version (4.12) and see there's been a vast improvement. It does look like a great program, but unfortunately, it's not free. There's a nice multi-computer discount for offices and home networks, though. At this point, I'll save the $30, and stay with Zsoft.
 
monitor an installation before you do the install otherwise the uninstaller doesn't know what has changed. ZSoft Uninstaller does this by taking a file and registry snapshot both before and after the install and then does a comparison to find what's changed.
 
A good second choice is Total Uninstall 2, the last free version of the commercial product Total Uninstall 2 which is still available from some download sites [5]. It doesn't offer the impressive features of the latest commercial version but is quite capable if a little slow compared to ZSoft.
 
This happened at least a couple of months ago. What I do remember is that they were some shared system files used by many programs, so who knows why it deemed them as installed by whatever program it was that I had used.
 
In any event this isn't a ZSoft Uninstaller bash fest, I want to make that very clear. For those that use and like it - each to their own, however the last free version of Total Uninstall does the job for me so it's my clear choice.

The standard uninstall a program control panel applet in Windows is not really suited for uninstalling software completely from the computer system. Why? Because it solely relies on the uninstallation software which more often than not misses files, folders and Registry settings. Microsoft has not really changed that control panel a lot, there are barely any differences between the feature in Windows XP and Windows 7.
 
Third party application uninstallers use two methods to thoroughly uninstall software: Some uninstallers, like Revo Uninstaller, scan the computer system after the default uninstallation for leftovers. They list the files and Registry keys found so that the user can delete them.
 
Then there are programs that offer to monitor software installations. These applications record every file, folder and Registry key created during installation. These information are then used during uninstallation to remove the software completely from
