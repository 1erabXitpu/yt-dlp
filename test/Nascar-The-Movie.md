The Chicago Park District will prioritize public access during the NASCAR Chicago Street Race, keeping more than half of the park open during the event, including set-up and tear-down. Access to popular park features like Buckingham Fountain, Butler Field, and Lower Hutchinson Field will remain accessible to the public with minimal restrictions that equate to less than one-fifth of event operation days.
 
The Chicago OEMC app is also a great tool to download as street closures and other event information will be added in the coming weeks. The app is available through the Apple App and Google Play stores or visit the website Chicago.gov/OEMC
 
Pole Markers/Location Identifiers: For public safety on the lakefront, race event and concert attendees are reminded to be aware of the numbers attached to the poles throughout the Grant Park area to help reference their location within the park if you call 9-1-1 in an emergency. 9-1-1 call takers and dispatchers will be able to provide the location to first responders. They can also be used between friends and family members as a meeting point if you become separated. For complete details, click HERE.
 
Motorists in the areas around Grant Park and the Loop during the week leading up to and during race weekend should be prepared for heavy traffic and possible reroutes. There will be some street closures to ensure public safety. Traffic Control Aides (TCAs) will be on site to direct flow and impacts from heavy traffic.
 
OEMC will continue to monitor events and weather and will issue any emergency alerts and notifications as necessary.
