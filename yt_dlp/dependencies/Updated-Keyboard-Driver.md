I got the same issue. I am a Help desk and most of our agents who have HP devices are having this issue and it is preventing them to access their remote desktop because the system is detecting that update that needs to be installed. I've checked other threads and running the wushowhide troubleshooter from Microsoft and DISM tool wont do any help.
 
I will give this a try, because the last time I tried to check the updates using the HP Assistant, the update for "Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P. - Keyboard - Standard 101/102-Key or Microsoft Neutral PS/2 Keyboard for HP Hotkey Support" didn't show up .
 
So why this driver : "Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P. - Keyboard - Standard 101/102-Key or Microsoft Neutral PS/2 Keyboard for HP Hotkey Support" keeps showing up if it is already installed? We cant tell the agents to ignore it since their remote desktop detects the driver update and it wont allow them to open it.
 
I'm also waiting for that patch that will provide permanent resolution on this one. It was funny that when I assisted an agent and she was with HP support doing a remote session with her laptop, they cant figure out what causing the drivers not to installed on the devices, and they already reset the laptop.

We found a workaround (cause we need to get them on the phone), we just suggested the agents to use a USB keyboard and keep on deleting the PS/2 driver on Device Manager (it keeps on coming back after the restart though), but c'mon, we need a permanent fix on this one.
 
Things are getting worse because for the past days, we have been receiving reports from the agents that another HP driver (Hewlett-Packard - Enterprise WSD Multi-Function Printer, Multi-Function Printer, Other hardware - HP Printer (BIDI)) is having an issue installing (aside from the Keyboard driver) that hinders them from logging in to their remote desktop. Good thing that we found a temporary fix to get rid off of those updates, but it was a tedious workaround.

But still wants to be installed. My laptop (in the last 3 days) has started running very slow compared to normal and the fan is constantly running even though the laptop is is cool, CPU usage is under 2-3% and the fan is running like a dog.
 
i would to be share a problem i have every time i update my bluetooth driver, i have Windows 10 21h2 and i update the Bluetooth driver when i have the notification with Intel Driver Assistant but after installation, i lost the keyboard and mouse. I every time need to remove it and re add it, it's very frustrating !
 
Please try installing the latest Bluetooth driver version 22.100.1.1 provided by Lenovo ( -and-netbooks/thinkpad-p-series-laptops/thinkpad-p15v-type-20tq-20tr/downloads/driver-list/component?name=Bluetooth%20and%20Modem) and check if the mouse and keyboard are still getting disconnected. I recommend you to perform a clean installation of the Bluetooth driver for this ( )
 
As well, since the issue does not happen with the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) drivers, it is important for you to know that OEM drivers are customized for your system, and it is recommended to have those installed. Please check for newer driver versions with the OEM.
 
As well, if other Bluetooth devices are working properly, there could be a compatibility issue with Logitech or the devices may need an update too. For this kind of devices, Logitech usually provides drivers/software, so we recommend contacting them and check if there is any update needed.

Keyboard stop working when I update keyboard driver, should be removed from update or something. I know its an official driver, but is bugged for this laptop. I can help with any detail (bios version, etc.) If you wanna fix it
 
Please go to Device Manager >> find and right click it >> choose Uninstall >> Reboot PC. See if everything is normal or not.
During the uninstall process, please make sure to tick 'Delete the Driver software for this device'.
 
Reboot PC. Tell us if the driver is installed successfully, or if your system is back to normal. No matter whether the problem is fixed or not, please let me know the result.
If the installation fails, please download , >> double click to run this tool >> click 'Save report to Desktop' >> find db\_info\_YYYYMMDD\_i.zip on your desktop >> send us the zip file. And also please send us the related screenshot of the error message you get when you install the driver.
We hope it can help you.
 
Hi! I had the same issue as Tibi, and uninstalling the driver solved my problem. But the link provided to reinstall the driver seems to not work anymore, could you please post another link where I can install the driver?

Thanks.
 
Upon imaging a Surface Laptop 2 with our basic image from the older Surface laptop model the Surface Hid Mini Driver driver fails to power and thus the keyboard doesn't work. if I revert back to 03/27/2017 driver it works fine... but then the laptop automatically updates itself to the latest version that brakes again. I have blocked the update in WSUS.
 
Is anybody aware of a fix for the latest driver? Does the PC somehow think its a Surface Laptop 1st gen and somehow downloading the incorrect driver possibly? I also downloaded the latest firmware/driver package from MS and tried that version and it also doesn't work. Seems to be the same exact version that gets downloaded from Windows Update.
 
@WC\_KStil did you ever get the specific version of the driver that works? I keep running into this issue every update cycle. I have a surface laptop 2 and the "Surface Hid Mini Driver" flakes out every update. I've tried the all of the drivers from Download Surface Laptop 2 Drivers and Firmware from Official Microsoft Download Center :
 
I've tried uninstalling the driver and re-installing but that never seems to work, even disabling the driver and re-enabling doesn't work. I'm not sure what happens in UEFI entry, but that seems to make it work again for me. Beware - your mileage may vary!!! This seems to be a very common issue but different tasks seem to work for different people. I sure hope Microsoft can fix this as it is a pain as it usually happens when I really need to get some work done!
 
Sign in and select Surface Laptop 2 and input your Surface's serial number. Click on Download and Save it to your desktop. Do not download the Recovery Image directly on the USB drive but on the Downloads folder on the computer.
 
@GBowlsby - this worked perfectly. Frustratingly, I'd foolishly listened to other ideas with consequences that'll now cost me even more time (somehow our AI/ML needs to intercept bad or half-arse solutions with ones that actually work :)) Regardless to my live 'en learn: Thanks!
 
Hello, I'm posting about my recent experiences with the Alienware m15 R4, which I purchased 5 months ago in November. Has anyone else with a Windows 11 Alienware laptop had issues with the keyboard ceasing to function? Sorry for the long post, but I do have some questions at the end.
 
After installing a Windows update in late March, I shut my laptop down after installing the update. The next morning, when I went to log back into the computer, the internal keyboard did not work. I didn't realize it at the time, though I've since worked it out with a technician's help, when the computer boots up into windows, the keyboard stops working, and it will continue to not work when restarting. However, on a cold boot after turning the computer off, the keyboard responds fully outside of Windows. I can go into BIOS etc outside of Windows and use the keyboard perfectly fine. However, the moment it reaches Windows, the keyboard ceases to function. This apparently means that the problem is a driver/software issue, is my understanding.
 
The first tech who came out to my house to deal with the problem disassembled the entire laptop and replaced the keyboard, which did not fix the problem. He insisted that I mail the laptop in for service, and it was mailed to the Texas facility where the motherboard and palm rest were both replaced. I suspect that the first tech, who was very young and inexperienced, may have broken said palm rest and panicked, considering the number of times he went outside to call his fiancee. However, that doesn't matter so much since the part was replaced free of cost.
 
The laptop's Windows was fully reinstalled etc, and when it arrived at my home, it booted up and worked fine, including the keyboard. However, while testing the laptop, I discovered that the speakers were now broken. Again, I suspect the original tech who was sent to my home, but again it doesn't matter how it happened. A second tech was sent out to my house to deal with the speaker problem, and he discovered a broken prong in a connector. When he returned later to replace the board and fix the speaker problem, he learned it was a daughter board p
