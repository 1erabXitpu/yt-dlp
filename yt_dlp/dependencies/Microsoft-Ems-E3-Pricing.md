In the future, Microsoft will assess pricing in local currency as part of a regular twice a year cadence, taking into consideration currency fluctuations relative to the USD.

Most folks on this thread (I believe) want to deploy chatbots with workflow to answer donor questions, better assist volunteers, etc. CoPilot for O365 does not do that. It does help with analyzing and reporting on data in your O365 Apps - but no joy for building chatbots.

Thanks for your question. I recommend posting your question in the Copilot for Microsoft 365 community as their product team would be able to answer your question regarding pricing and if there are any trials available.
 
Out-of-warranty pricing includes applicable taxes with the exception of Canada, India, and United States. Pricing may vary with other service providers. Out-of-warranty offers may not be available for all countries or products. See drop down for the current list of out-of-warranty offers.

Copilot in the Power BI, Data Factory, and Data Science/Data Engineering experiences allow you to ask questions and receive answers that are contextualized on your data. Using Fabric Copilot consumes capacity units from your existing Fabric capacity, there is no need to buy separate capacity.
 
Once Fabric Copilot receives your prompt, it retrieves relevant data, such as the dataset, to improve the specificity of the prompt. This ensures that you receive actionable information that is relevant to your specific task. Data retrieval is limited to data that is accessible to you based on your permissions.
 
Our statistics show that the average consumption for each Power BI Copilot request is around 1,500 CU seconds. Power BI will cache the input tokens for 2 days, and when the same prompt is re-run, no usage will be recorded. Running the same prompt on the same data also results in a much faster response, and Copilot only charges me once!
 
According to Fabric pricing table, if your capacity is in Central US, 1 CU costs $0.18 per hour for Pay-as-you-go and $0.107 per hour for reservation. This example will cost $0.63 for Pay-as-you-go and $0.38 for reservation. You can use this example as a reference to estimate your own costs for using Fabric Copilot based on your own scenarios and usage patterns.
