In Dynamics 365 Commerce, the term shift describes the collection of POS transactional data and activities between two points in time. For each shift, the amount of money that is expected is compared against the amount that was counted and declared.
 
Typically, shifts are opened at the start of the business day. At that point, a user declares the starting amount that the cash drawer contains. Sales transactions are then performed throughout the day. Finally, at the end of the day, the drawer is counted, and the closing amounts are declared. The shift is closed, and a Z report is generated. The Z report indicates whether there is an overage or shortage.

Traditionally, this scenario has been used most often. It's still extensively used. In a "fixed till" shift, the shift and till are associated with a specific register. They aren't moved from one register to another. A "fixed till" shift can be used by a single user or shared among multiple users. "Fixed till" shifts don't require any special configuration.
 
In a "floating till" shift, the shift and cash drawer can be moved from one register to another. Although a register can have only one active shift per cash drawer, shifts can be suspended and then resumed later or on a different register.
 
For example, a store has two registers. Each register is opened at the start of the day when the cashier opens a new shift and provides the starting amount. When one cashier is ready to take a break, that cashier suspends their shift and removes the till from the cash drawer. That register then becomes available to other cashiers. Another cashier can sign in to and open their own shift on the register. After the first cashier's break has ended, that cashier can resume their shift when one of the other registers becomes available. "Floating till" shifts don't require any special configuration or permission.
 
Many retailers prefer to allow only one user per shift, to help guarantee the highest level of accountability for the cash in the cash drawer. If only one user is allowed to use the till that is associated with a shift, that user can be held solely responsible for any discrepancies. If more than one user uses a shift, it's difficult to determine who made an error, or who might be trying to steal from the till.
 
Some retailers are willing to sacrifice the level of accountability that single-user shifts provide and to allow more than one user per shift. This approach is typical when there are more users than available registers, and the need for flexibility and speed outweighs the potential for loss. It's also typical when store managers don't have their own shifts but can, as required, use the shifts of any of their cashiers. To sign in to and use a shift that was opened by another user, a user must have the **Allow multiple shift logon** POS permission.

A "shared shift" configuration lets retailers have a single shift across multiple registers, cash drawers, and users. A shared shift has a single starting amount and a single closing amount that are summarized across all cash drawers. Shared shifts are most typical when mobile devices are used. In this scenario, a separate cash drawer isn't reserved for each register. Instead, all registers can share one cash drawer.
 
For shared shifts to be used in a store, the cash drawer must be configured as a "shared shift drawer" at **Retail and Commerce > Channel setup > POS setup > POS profiles > Hardware profiles > Drawer**. Additionally, users must have one or both of the shared shift permissions (Allow manage shared shift and Allow use shared shift).
 
Various operations can be performed to change the state of a shift, or to increase or decrease the amount of money in the cash drawer. This section describes these shift operations for Store Commerce.
 
When a user signs in to the POS, the system first verifies whether an active shift is available for that user on the current register. If an active shift isn't available, the user can open a new shift, resume an existing shift, or sign in in "non-drawer" mode, depending on the system configuration and the user's permissions.
 
This operation is often the first operation that is performed for a newly opened shift. For this operation, users specify the starting cash amount in the cash drawer for the shift. This operation is important because the overage/shortage calculation that occurs when a shift is closed considers the start amount.
 
Float entries are non-sales transactions that are performed in an active shift to increase the amount of cash in the cash drawer. A typical example of a float entry is a transaction to add additional change to the drawer when it's running low.
 
Tender removals are non-sales transactions that are performed in an active shift to reduce the amount of cash in the cash drawer. This operation is most often used in conjunction with a Float entry operation on a different shift. For example, because register 1 is running low on change, the user on register 2 does a tender removal to reduce the amount in their cash drawer. The user on register 1 then does a float entry to increase the amount in their cash drawer.
 
Users can suspend their active shift to free up the current register for another user, or to move their shift to a different register (in this case, the shift is often referred to as a "floating till" shift).
 
This operation is performed to specify the total amount of money that is currently in the cash drawer. Users most often perform this operation before they close a shift. The specified amount is compared against the expected shift amount to calculate the overage/shortage amount.
 
Safe drops can be done on an active shift at any time. This operation removes money from the cash drawer so that it can be transferred to a more secure location, such as a safe in the back room. The total amount that is recorded for safe drops is included in shift totals, but it doesn't have to be counted as part of the tender declaration.
 
Blind-closed shifts are no longer active but haven't been fully closed. Unlike suspended shifts, blind-closed shifts can't be resumed. However, operations such as Declare start amount and Tender declaration can be performed on them later or from a different register.
 
This operation calculates shift totals and overage/shortage amounts, and then finalizes an active or blind-closed shift. Depending on the user's permissions, a Z report is also printed for the shift. Closed shifts can't be resumed or modified.
 
This operation lets users view all active, suspended, and blind-closed shifts for the store. Depending on their permissions, users can perform their final closing procedures, such as Tender declaration and Close shift operations for blind-closed shifts. This operation also lets users view and delete invalid shifts, in the rare event that shifts are left in a bad state after a switch between offline and online modes. These invalid shifts don't contain any financial information or transactional data that is required for reconciliation.
 
The way that shifts and cash drawer reconciliation are used in the POS differs from the way that transaction data is summarized during statement calculation. It's important that you understand this difference. Depending on your configuration and your business processes, the shift data in the POS (the Z report) and a calculated statement in the back office can give you different results. This difference doesn't necessarily mean that either the shift data or the calculated statement is incorrect, or that there is a problem with the data. It just means that the parameters that are provided might be including additional transaction or fewer transactions, or that the transactions have been summarized differently.
 
We have lots of cash sales that are registered in a POS application. As for now we just push the totals per month as a cash receipt from a fake POS Customer. Similarly also petty cash accounts overviews are now mainly managed on the side via another app as Manager does not have an app like Wave that easily can enter cash payments and cash receipts. The apps both can export spreadsheet and/or CSV files and have mainly similar data as in bank accounts. So I fully support this request to be able to import cash records simuilar to how bank statements get imported into bank with cash rules as in bank rules. This will allow us, accountants and auditors to track and trace everything in Manager.
 
However, since we are already here, instead of splitting the import, we can extend the bank statements import functionality to cash which is the only alternative that seems to utilize available functionality.
 
Mmm, I actually do not see where a split or merger of bank and cash is more than cosmetic at the moment and just as we hoped reduces the number of tabs, be it with 1 only. Nothing changed in terms of functionality, and I do not think it will now and/or in the future. Just try it, you will see that it works very fine. Petty cash accounting can be viewed as similar to Bank accounting the way one keeps records of payments and receipts. I realize that I have a desire to store the information as with Bank in Manager and the pragmatic but also future proof way is just to treat it/them as a Bank account. Notwithstanding, you can raise questions why it would not be implemented for cash accounts, what is the problem? Similarly why is functionality of Inventory and Non-Inventory items not treated similarly with similar forms and options as would be for Bank and Cash, even the way they are used (one as Tab the other in Settings). I know this may degress from the point but coe argument is why are these items Cash and Bank treated so differently as in Accouting we even refer to them as Cash or Cash equivalents and both can
