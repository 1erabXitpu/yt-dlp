Together, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) have increased the expectation that students with disabilities will participate in the general education classroom as well as in state and district testing to the greatest extent possible. Unfortunately, students with disabilities often experience challenges or barriers that interfere with their ability to access and demonstrate learning. Barriers to learning can be associated with:
 
Teachers should provide accommodations that meet the unique needs of each individual student. Not all students with the same disability or even those who experience the same barrier will benefit from the same accommodation. For example, not all students with visual impairments will benefit from Braille materials; some might be better served by audio books.

It is a common misconception that accommodations offer an unfair advantage to students with disabilities. Used appropriately, accommodations level the playing field, allowing students with disabilities the opportunity to perform tasks as well as students without disabilities.
 
Modifications are adaptations that change **what** students learn and are used with students who require more support or adjustments than accommodations can provide. Whereas accommodations level the playing field, modifications change the playing field. Unlike accommodations, modifications:
 
Teachers might believe that, if they are already using differentiated instruction or Universal Design for Learning (UDL), they do not need to provide accommodations for students with disabilities. Although these approaches might meet the needs of many, some students with disabilities will require the further support or services that accommodations offer.
 
Each of the following scenarios introduces a student with a disability and identifies his or her related challenge. For each student, the teacher implements several types of supports. Determine whether each support is an accommodation, modification, or strategy/intervention.
 
With careful planning and consideration, teachers can provide accommodations to their students effectively and efficiently. With individualized accommodations in place, these students are more likely to successfully access and demonstrate learning.

Are supports or services provided to help students progress in the general education curriculum and demonstrate their learning. Accommodations do not mean big change in the instructional level, content, or standards. Rather, support is provided so that students have an equal opportunity to learn and to demonstrate what they have learned.
 
Large print - Large print editions of tests are required for some students with visual impairments. A regular print test can be enlarged through photocopying, or an electronic version of a test can be manipulated to reformat test items and enlarge or change the font as needed. The latter method is preferable. All text and graphic materials, including labels and captions on pictures, diagrams, maps, charts, exponential numbers, notes, and footnotes, must be presented in at least 18-point type for students who need large print. If a student needs a large print test edition, be sure it is ordered in plenty of time to be available for the test. After a student finishes a large-print edition of a test, someone needs to transcribe the student's answers verbatim onto a standard answer sheet.
 
Audio tape or compact disk - A test may be prerecorded on an audio cassette or compact disk that a student accesses by listening. Some states provide tests recorded on audiotape. Advantages include ease of operation and low cost. An audio version of a test is not useful for a student who is not familiar, skilled, and comfortable taking tests with this accommodation. It is critical for students to use this accommodation regularly in classroom work and on classroom and practice tests before using it on a test for accountability.
 
Modifications: At our school we was not allowed to modify State assessments. Our students received a different test that had already been modified for them. For classroom assessments we could use modifications.
 
We used book that a student would be interested in for example everyone else might have read a book about the United States. For the student who need a modification who is interested in food. We would read a book about cuisine in the United States.
 
**Communication Protocol:**In an effort to keep individuals well informed regarding testing security policies and procedures, the OSA recommends the following system for communication exchange. This protocol serves the purpose of connecting all individuals involved in the testing community in order to better impact policy decision making. There is a two-way communication exchange between each level, which is particularly important in maintaining test security. The protocol for communication exchange for test security is Office of Standards and Assessment >< District Assessment Coordinator >< Building Assessment Coordinator >< Test Administrator/Proctor.

Instructional accommodations are changes to the delivery of classroom instruction or the accompanying materials. Instructional accommodations change **how** students learn but do not change **what** they learn. In other words, they do not alter the scope or range of the grade-level academic content standards, nor do they change the complexity of the knowledge students are expected to learn. Students with disabilities who use instructional accommodations are required to learn the same content at the same level of proficiency as their peers who do not use instructional accommodations.
 
Rae, a student with a learning disability (LD), struggles to identify and remember important information. To address this barrier, any time her science teacher uses a handout (digital or hardcopy) in class, she provides one to Rae with the key information already highlighted.
 
Because students experience changing demands throughout the school day, accommodations are likely to differ from one class setting to another. For instance, just because Rae benefits from the accommodation outlined above in her science class does not mean that she will necessarily require it in algebra.
 
The implementation of certain kinds of technology as well as instructional practices or frameworks like differentiated instruction or Universal Design for Learning (UDL) not only allow teachers to enhance learning for all students, they also inherently address many of the learning barriers faced by students with disabilities.
 
When educators implement current technology and practices that enhance learning for all students, the discussion regarding accommodations needed to meet the needs of individual students may change. Listen as Candace Cortiella discusses this further (time: 1:15).
 
Testing accommodations are changes to the format of a test (e.g., providing a test in large print) or its administration procedures (e.g., permitting extended time to complete the test). Testing accommodations change **how** students are tested but do not change **what** a test measures. Students with disabilities who receive testing accommodations are required to take the same assessment and reach the same level of proficiency as students who do not use them.
 
Listen as Ryan Kettler discusses this issue in more detail. Further, he discusses that though testing accommodations provide a student with a disability better access to the curriculum, such access does not automatically equate to higher scores on tests or better grades on class assignments. Even with the help of accommodations, the student may not understand the content and successfully demonstrate his or her knowledge (time: 3:39).
 
Being able to differentiate between target skills and access skills is critical for determining the types of testing accommodations that will allow a student the opportunity to demonstrate his or her knowledge and skills. Recall that testing accommodations change how students are tested but do not change what a test measures. Read on to learn more about classroom and standardized assessment accommodations.
 
Recent years have seen a shift in the way standardized tests are administered, from a paper to an online format. This shift has allowed for universally designed assessments, which incorporate digital tools and features that increase accessibility for all students and eliminate obstacles often encountered by students with disabilities (as well as other students such as English language learners). A number of states now use a multi-tiered approach that allows students to access the content. Typically, this incorporates three
